            <h2>The current situation of stray cats</h2>
            <p>In the streets and alleys of the city, countless stray cats are struggling to survive. They face multiple challenges such as food shortages, bad weather, diseases and human indifference. Many cats lose their lives because they are not rescued in time. They are innocent, but they have to endure pain that does not belong to them.</p>
